    The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.

Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.Tip: The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.

The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID is only used to identify one single element in our HTML.
 IDs are only used when one element on the page should have a particular style applied to it.
  However, a class can be used to identify more than one HTML element.
