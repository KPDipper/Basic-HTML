The <input type="hidden"> defines a hidden input field (not visible to a user).
A hidden field lets web developers include data that cannot be seen or modified by users when a form is submitted.
A hidden field often stores what database record that needs to be updated when the form is submitted.

<label for="hidd">Hidden</label>
<input type="hidden" id="hidd"><br><br>


tel:
<label for="telephone">Phone number</label>

<pre>
    The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, 
        such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.


    for form atrributes
    The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.
    get user lai kei information dinu cha bhane garnu parne ho
    post tai user bata kei input linu parcha bhane post garne ho
   Get: 1.This method is useful for form submissions where a user want to bookmark the result
        2.There is a limit to how much data you can place in a URL (varies between browsers), therefore,
        you cannot be sure that all of the form-data will be correctly transferred
        3.Never use the "get" method to pass sensitive information! (password or other sensitive information will be visible in the browser's address bar)
     
    Post:This method sends the form-data as an HTTP post transaction
    Form submissions with the "post" method cannot be bookmarked
    The "post" method is more robust and secure than "get", and "post" does not have size limitations  


    The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.
    for eg the form data is sent to a file called "action_page.php"
    Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.

    The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.


    _blank:The response is displayed in a new window or tab
    _self:The response is displayed in the current window
    _top	The response is displayed in the full body of the window

<pre>
    The <input type="submit"> defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler.

The form-handler is typically a file on the server with a script for processing input data.

The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute.
